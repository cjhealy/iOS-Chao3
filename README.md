# Chao-3 - An Exploration of C# and Unity


Project name:   
*    Chao-3

Description:  
*    An exploration of the popular match-three puzzle genre. I began this project in search of a creative way to teach myself C# and Unity. The goal     of the project is to build a fully functional match-three game that incorporates aspects of Sonic's Chao Island. Currently, the game is a completely functional match-three game with multiple level types and special pieces. The next step is building the Chao side.


Credits:  
*    Lots of credit goes to Kelley Hecker whose tutorials have helped tremendously.
