# match-three


Project name:   
    Chao-3

Description:  
    An exploration of the popular match-three genre. I began this project in search of a creative way to teach myself C# and Unity. The goal of the project is to build a fully functional match-three game that incorporates aspects of Sonic's Chao Island. Currently, the game is a completely functional match-three game with multiple level types and special pieces. The next step is building the Chao side.
